OMG!  How cute is this!  I am making my very own blog page.  Yippee!<br><br>JKJKJKJK...In all seriousness, I am very excited to be starting the part time program at <a href="http://www.themakersquare.com">The Maker Sqaure</a>!  I've already learned quite a bit from the pre-work alone.  It's going to be a grea journey and I know I have a lot to learn, but I am ready to tackle it.  Bring it on!<br>
